# Housing-Price-Prediction
Hi, this is my project for a Kaggle case compeition!


To begin with, here is the case description:
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement 
ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that
much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this 
competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

To solve this problem, I compared the rmse ridge and lasso regression model to predict the price
and then applied Xgboost to enhance the accuracy.

For more details, please refer to the file named "Lasso_Xgboost_HousePricePrediction.ipynb"

Thank you and enjoy~
